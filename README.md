# Pong_Paddle_Pets
The Purpose of this Repos is to explore Reinforcement Learning through training two paddles to play pong.
The initial work explores them competing to win with limited information about game state and simple 3 layer linear neural net.  

Future work will explore improving the access to information i.e. using the view of the game as opposed to constructed inputs and use vision based ML techniques. 

Another project may look at how we can use rewards to develop different behaviours. For example can we edge the ML towards co-operation over attempts to win the game?
